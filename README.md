This collection includes two tools to verify cloud guardrail compliance:

- CLI Tool: written in Go as a small binary that can be executed in a CI pipeline
- Inspec control suite: written in Ruby as a compliance definition suite to be imported into a larger, application leve, compliance auditing tool.
